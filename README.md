# Crawl Novel & Text-to-Speech (TTS)

This project is designed to provide two key functionalities: web scraping of novel content and text-to-speech (TTS) conversion. Users can either crawl novel chapters from websites and convert them to audio or use the text-to-speech feature directly. The project supports multiple TTS services, including AWS and Azure, offering a wide variety of voices in both English and Vietnamese.

## Features

### Crawl Novel & Text-to-Speech:

- Crawl novel content from selected websites.
- Convert crawled text to audio files in formats such as MP3 or WAV.
- Allows user selection for specific chapters to crawl and convert.
- Utilizes modern TTS services to provide natural-sounding voices.
- Supports multiple languages (English and Vietnamese) and various voice options.

### Text-to-Speech Only:

- Directly convert any input text to audio using AWS or Azure TTS services.
- Customize the voice (male, female, etc.) and language (English, Vietnamese).
- High-quality output in MP3, WAV, and other formats.

## Supported TTS Services

- **AWS:** Provides a variety of natural-sounding voices in multiple languages.
